This is the moment we have been working like mad for all semester to get
to! The moment of truth. We build the compiler! You've got this! I
have selected 300+ test files that will be compiled using your
compiler.   The compile compiles a program of the form xxx.c- to
a TM file called xxx.tm.   The compile statement is generally:

</p><pre>c- testfile.c-
</pre>
which will create a testfile.tm.   The tm program can then be used
to load and run the code:
<pre>tm testfile.tm
</pre>

A description of the tm machine is described here including the
commands for use of the tm, instruction set, idioms, examples
of segments of code for specific purposes:
<a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/tmDescription.pdf">tmDescription.pdf</a>
<p>

IMPORTANT: grading is dependent on the output of running the program
you have compiled. I will not be testing that your tm code is correct.
It will test that the tm code generated by your compiler runs correctly.
The test data files include an script called runExamples that is
similar to what is run on the actual test machine.

</p><p>

You have hundreds of examples of compiled code.
For debugging purposes you might want to look at the Unit tests to
focus in on specific functionality. Each file will be compiled with
your compiler and the resulting tm code will be run on TM 4.5b. The
output of the TM run will be compared to the expected output. If it
passes the test an "Output OK" will be given. If not the difference
will be printed in the standard side by side way.  See the script
runExamples in the testData file for an approximate example you
can use for testing on your unix machine.

</p><p>

You may use <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/emitcode.cpp">emitcode.cpp</a> and <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/emitcode.h">emitcode.h</a> to emit tm instructions. The current
version of the tm machine is <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/tm.c">tm.c</a> and is an extension
of the tm from the book. Here is the manual for the tiny machine: <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/tmDescription.pdf">tmDescription.pdf</a>.   Be sure to download the
latest and to get any bug fixes.

</p><p>

An example of <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/ioLibrary.tm">the I/O Library</a> that belongs at the
beginning of the code is provided.   The I/O Library routines are each in a kind of
iconical format but you can code them more "tightly" if you choose.
What matters is the output of your compiled code when run on TM.

</p><p>

Like all real world projects you start with grand ambitions embodied
in a list of features you hope to implement. As with real projects, as
we approach the release deadline, features must be put on the chopping
block to meet the deadline. So it is with our project. While we must
continue to support the full language for the memory assignment A6, we
trim features for A7 code generation to meet our deadline. You will
find the following has been removed from A7 i.e. you <b>do not</b>
have to do the following:

</p><p>

</p><ul>

<p>
</p><li> <b>for</b> loops

<p>
</p></li><li> <b>whole array</b> value assignments, array initializations, and
array comparisons.  This includes string related functionality (you must do character
things, however). You will have to do array indexing and array sizes
have to be set properly.   Too bad.   This is fun.

<p>
</p></li><li> <b>static variables</b> you will still have to do globals, parameters, and locals.

</li></ul>

<p>

To make this happen the tests will have the above features
removed from the test suite programs. Let me know if you find a file
where I haven't. You will still have to do function calls, arrays,
while, global and local variables, parameter passing of arrays, etc.

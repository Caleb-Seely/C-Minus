<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>
This homework consists of these tasks:
</p><ul>
<li>Tweak-in some improvements to the interface.
</li><li>Use Flex and Bison to
build a parser for the <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/c-Grammar.pdf">C- language</a>.
</li><li>While doing the parsing you will construct the syntax tree.  This
is <b>not</b> the full annotated syntax tree yet but just the initial abstract syntax tree.
</li><li>
You will write the procedure <b>printTree</b> which will
print out the tree <b>exactly</b> as I have in the examples I
give below and in the test data.  Almost the same format is not good enough.  The
more I have to work to show your output is the same the fewer points you get.
You need to fill the tree nodes with just enough information to get the tree
printed correctly.
Your main program will contain:
<p>
</p><pre>yyparse();         // parse and build the tree in the global var syntaxTree.
if (printTreeFlag) printTree(stdout, syntaxTree);
</pre>
<p>
The first line calls the parser which will store the tree in
the global called <b>syntaxTree</b> which is defined:
</p></li></ul>

<b><font color="red">Do not be fooled.  This is a nontrivial homework.
Do not put off this
assignment.  It is complicated and detailed. </font></b>
</td><td><img src="./CS445 - Assignment 2_files/skull.gif"></td>
</tr></tbody></table> 
</center>

<p>
These tasks are described further below. 
</p><p>

</p><h3>Improving the interface</h3>
<p>
When done with this assignment you will have created code that will
recognize legal <b>C-</b> programs and generate the first pass at
the abstract syntax tree.
</p><p>

The parser will be named <b>c-</b> just like last time.  It will read
and process a stream of tokens from a filename given as an
argument to the <b>c-</b> command OR from standard input if the 
filename argument is not present.

</p><p>

I recommend
using the <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/getopt.txt">getopt</a> routine to handle
UNIX command line arguments in a uniform and standard way and make your life easier.
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/getopt.txt">The getopt man page</a>
</li><li><a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/ourgetopt.h">The ourgetopt header file</a>
</li><li><a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/ourgetopt.cpp">A ourgetopt replacement</a> that does what gnu getopt does but you can
compile anywhere.
</li><li><a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/ourgetoptTest.cpp">A ourgetopt example program that takes various options.  Play with this
to understand how getopt works.</a>
</li></ul>
Be sure to use ourgetopt.  It is more resilient than some.
And be sure to include the getopt code in your tar!

<p>

Your program will now also take (using ourgetopt) the <b>-d</b> option as an argument.   The
<b>-d</b> option turns on the yydebug flag by setting it to 1.
For example: <b>c- -d sort.c-</b> should run the <b>c-</b> compiler on
the program sort.c- and give details of the parsing that is going on.
While <b>c- sort.c-</b> should simply run the <b>c-</b> compiler.  

</p><p>

The abstract syntax tree will be printed if the <b>-p</b> is given. So
<b>c- -p sort.c-</b> will print the abstract syntax tree (AST) for the
assignment and <b>c- sort.c-</b> will not print the AST.


</p><h3>The Parser</h3>
<p>

For the parsing part of the assignment replace your assignment 1 Bison
grammar with the grammar to parse C- code. A good approach is to
initially forget about the syntax tree part of the assignment. If you
get the right grammar into your compiler it will successfully parse
any <b>C-</b> program. A program that simply recognizes whether a
program is legal or not is called a <b>recognizer</b>. If you build
your Bison grammar directly from the grammar supplied, you will find
that you have the dangling else problem. There are several ways to fix
this problem. I have discussed one in class. See the <a href="http://marvin.cs.uidaho.edu/Teaching/CS445/danglingElse.html"> handout on the dangling else problem</a>.

</p><p>

To be successful, you need to get a clean compile of your grammar in
Bison with <b>no shift-reduce or reduce-reduce errors</b>. Those
indicate that your grammar is ambiguous. Bison will make a decision
for you and go ahead and generate code making a selection of its
choice e.g. reduce before shift. But you must decide for yourself and
fix the grammar to be unambiguous.

</p><p>

<b><font color="red">Coding restriction:</font></b> Do not attempt to
fix dangling else or any other grammar issue with associativity
declarations such as <b>%left</b>, <b>%right</b>, or <b>%assoc</b>. Do
not fix any other problem with your grammar by using the
<b>%expect</b> feature of Bison. This causes Bison to ignore some
number of parsing errors and me to deduct points from your assignment.
Really, you have the knowledge now to do this with out this "feature".
<b>IMPORTANT: I expect your parser to compile without any parser
errors.</b>

</p><p>
Now that your recognizer is working, let's look at the syntax tree I want
you to produce.  As we will discuss in class, the tree is an abbreviated portion
of the parse tree containing the parts we are interested in.  Here is a sample 
TreeNode that I used based on the book.  You can use what you want.  I will be
giving examples in class based on the one in the book.: 
</p><pre>typedef struct treeNode
{
    // connectivity in the tree
    struct treeNode *child[MAXCHILDREN];   // children of the node
    struct treeNode *sibling;              // siblings for the node

    // what kind of node
    int lineno;                            // linenum relevant to this node
    NodeKind nodekind;                     // type of node
    union                                  // subtype of type
    {
	DeclKind decl;                     // used when DeclK
	StmtKind stmt;                     // used when StmtK
	ExpKind exp;                       // used when ExpK
    } kind;
    
    // extra properties about the node depending on type of the node
    union                                  // relevant data to type -&gt; attr
    {
        OpKind op;                         // type of token (same as in bison)
	int value;                         // used when an integer constant or boolean
        unsigned char cvalue               // used when a character
	char *string;                      // used when a string constant
	char *name;                        // used when IdK
    } attr;                                 
    ExpType expType;		           // used when ExpK for type checking
    bool isArray;                          // is this an array
    bool isStatic;                         // is staticly allocated?

    // even more semantic stuff will go here in later assignments.
} TreeNode;
</pre>
<p>
This design is stolen straight from the book.  This way you can
use the one in the Tiny compiler in the book as an example to work from.  Ours has to
have extra features and node types.  We will discuss this in detail in
class.  Feel free to use a class rather than a struct in this case if you like.
Or feel free to use the modern struct rather than using typedefs.  I do.
You can actually use any data structure you like as long as the output
matches mine and it builds a tree of the same shape as mine.   You
will need to traverse the tree to do all the remaining assignments.

</p><p>
To encode the program as a tree you need to make the right nodes
at the right steps in the parsing.  When you need to make a node you
will use routines you write similar to the <b>newStmtNode</b> 
function in <b>util.c</b> for the Tiny language in the book. 
These nodes will be passed up the
tree as pointers and assembled as in the tiny example in the book.
This means that many of the nonterminals will be of type pointer to a node!
<b><font color="red">Coding restriction:</font></b>
<b>Do not use YYSTYPE</b> as used in the book.  This subverts the type checking features that
are there to <b>help you</b>.  I will take off for using it.
USE THE UNION Luke!   Here is an example of
what could be in your union.   It is up to you what you want to put
in your union.  This is influenced by the types you want for your
nonterminals.  Mine is a bit simpler for example.:
</p><pre>%union { 
    ExpType type;            // typespec to pass up in a declaration like int, char, or bool
    TokenData *tokenData;    // token data comes in on tokens from yylex() in the $ variables
    TreeNode *tree;          // for nonterminals.   these tree nodes as you build the tree
}
</pre>
<p> 

</p><h3>The Parser and printTree</h3>
<p>
So what should the tree look like for a given program?
This is essentially described the the Bison code.  I think
the best way to describe this is in class and by example.
</p><p>
To understand the examples you must understand the output format
of the <b>printTree</b> function.
The <b>printTree</b> function prints the the important 
information contained in the node.  It then applies the <b>printTree</b> function
to all the nonnull children and prints them out numbered starting with child[0] being numbered 
"Child 0" etc.  It then it applies <b>printTree</b> to the
<b>sibling</b> pointer if it is nonnull.  The first sibling
found is numbered 1.  Reading the syntax tree printed
for sample input programs shows you what to do in each case.
I will supply you with a crazy number of examples.

For example, given this program:
</p><pre> 
// C-F20
int main()
{
    int x;
    int y[5];
    bool b;

    b = true | false &amp; 11 + 22 * 33 / 44 &gt; 55;

    if (666&gt;777) {
        x = 111;
    }
    else y[3] = x+222;

    while (x&gt;999) {
        x = 333;
        if (x&lt;9) break;
        x = 444;
        break;
   }

   for (z in y) if (z&gt;x) x = z;
}
</pre>
<p>
you should get the following output from your <b>c-</b>.
This is the output I will compare against in the tests!

</p><p>
In the cases where there is an absent optional expression or statement the
corresponding child pointer is set to NULL (i.e. 0).
For example compound statements might not have any declarations so <b>child[0]</b>
pointer would be set to NULL.  Return optionally takes an expression.  If there isn't an
expression then the <b>Child[0]</b> pointer is NULL.  The while statement might not
have a body: for example <b>while (searching());</b> in which case <b>child[1]</b>
is NULL.  The default for unneeded children and siblings is always the NULL pointer!
<b>This means your code has to check for NULL pointers and alter its behavior.</b>
Use defensive programming and you will save time!  Never use a pointer without
checking it is non-null.  (You can use safe pointer objects if you like.  Maybe overkill?)
</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>HINT:</b> The yacc code in the book is a good example of how to
connect the nodes you create.  The node create code is a good model
for how to create nodes and print a tree.  Use your notes from class
on how to put the rest of it together.  The calculator example we did in class works
great for a example of how to organize the interaction between flex and bison parts.
</p><p>
Sizes of arrays, locations in memory, etc will all be handled in latter assignments.
</p><p>
IMPORTANT: For this assignment, I will only give you legal C- code.
Error handling is coming.

</p><h2>Nonterminal Names in your Bison Grammar</h2>

My Bison grammar uses shortened names as well as
changes required for this assignment.  The reasons are specifically:
<ol>
<li> I have abbreviated nonterminal names to shorten line length and
improve reability of Bison code and output. Really helps.

</li><li> You have to implement the dangling else solution in the grammar as
part of this assignment or it won't compile.  And the solution
has to work with looping commands. See the doc on dangling else on
the class page. That changes the grammar and is why some of the names
are added or missing. That is a big helpful hint!   Why these nonterminals
added and subtracted?

</li><li> I also used assignOp for all assign operators much like mulop and sumop.
So that is an added non terminal.

<h2>Submission</h2>

<p> Homework will be submitted as an <b>uncompressed</b> tar file
that contains no subdirectories.
The tar file is submitted to the class submission page.
You can submit as many times as you like.
<b>The LAST file you submit BEFORE the deadline will be the one
graded.</b> Absolutely, no late papers.  For all submissions you will
receive email at your uidaho address showing how your file performed
on the pre-grade tests.  The grading program will use more extensive
tests, so thoroughly test your program with inputs of your own.

Your code should compile and run with runtime errors such as seg faults.
If it doesn't, it is considered nearly ungradable.
